/**
 * Consecutive-failure breaker keyed on the target an operation names.
 *
 * `budget.maxRetries` covers a blip inside one task and nothing carried further:
 * a workflow whose node keeps failing against the same host, file, or command
 * would spend every remaining step rediscovering that. One breaker instance is
 * shared by the whole controller, so tasks that are unrelated except for their
 * target still trip it together, and a workflow's nodes inherit it because they
 * run through that same controller.
 *
 * `check` reports without recording; `recordFailure` and `recordSuccess` are the
 * writes. Only a failure to reach the target counts. A `partial` clears the
 * count like a success does — the adapter reached the target and the evidence
 * disagreed, which is a verification problem, not an unreachable target — and a
 * cancellation counts neither way, being the operator's doing.
 *
 * ponytail: in-memory, per process. A breaker is a live health signal, so a
 * restart starting closed is the honest default; persist it if operators start
 * asking why a fresh process retries a target they know is down.
