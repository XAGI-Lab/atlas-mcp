// Bounded recursive script runner: `node scripts/run-recursive.mjs <script>`.
//
// Every recursive fan-out in this workspace multiplies. `pnpm -r test` runs N
// packages in flight and each one starts a bare `vitest run` that sizes its own
// fork pool from the core count, so a 10-core machine peaked near 40 Node
// processes and exhausted memory. `pnpm -r build` and `pnpm -r typecheck` have
// one level instead of two, but each `tsc` holds a whole program graph in
// memory, so pnpm's default of four in flight is several GiB on its own.
//
// This caps the fan-out from one place and derives the cap from the machine
// rather than a number that happens to fit the author's laptop.
